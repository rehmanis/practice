# Problem Statement

In the programming language of your choice, implement an API that takes the filename of a comma-separated value (CSV) file and provides convenient access to its values.

Hereâ€™s an example of a CSV file:

```
location,employee,favorite fruit,details,favorite movie
Austin,Alice,Apple,likes red apples,Batman
Boston,Bob,Bosc Pear,likes yellow pears,Batman
```

## Follow Up

How would you modify the code so that comma can be part of the content as well? For example, one way would be to escape the commas that are not delimiters as shown below.

```
location,employee,favorite fruit,details,favorite movie
Austin,Alice,Apple,likes red apples,Batman
Washington\,DC,Bob,Bosc Pear,likes big\,yellow\,juicy pears,Batman
```
